# Routes

Routes is the first app in which I used MapKit, to make a Navigation App.

## Description

* For this project, I took the help of Sean Allens on YouTube, and made a maps app, that has three features, as of v1.0

## Features:

* A button to bring the focus of the map view to the user's current location
* A button to show the address of the pin placed on the map view
* A button to show the optimum, time-saving directions to the location, chosen by the user

## Drawbacks:

* Currently, I haven't fixed the issue where a user chooses to get directions for two locations, at the moment, the app
  does not discard the previous directions before showing the new one.

## Possible features that I may add:

* A step-by-step route map
* An option to choose the mode of transport
* A way to save favourite locations
